Rock Paper Scissors Game
This Rock Paper Scissors game is a fully functional web-based application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows a player to compete against a computer in a classic game of strategy and chance. The user interface is interactive, the design is clean, and the gameplay is responsive and easy to use.

The game works by letting the player choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The computer then randomly makes its selection. Once both choices are made, the result is immediately displayed on the screen, along with updated scores. The logic follows the standard rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. If both the player and the computer make the same choice, the round is a draw.
